  "readme": "# react-sticky [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/captivationsoftware/react-sticky.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/captivationsoftware/react-sticky)\n\nMake your React components sticky!\n\n#### Demos\n\n* [Basic](http://react-sticky.netlify.com/#/basic)\n* [Relative](http://react-sticky.netlify.com/#/relative)\n* [Stacked](http://react-sticky.netlify.com/#/stacked)\n\n#### Version 6.x Highlights\n\n* Completely redesigned to support sticky behavior via higher-order component, giving you ultimate control of implementation details\n* Features a minimal yet efficient API\n* Drops support for versions of React < 15.3. If you are using an earlier version of React, continue to use the 5.x series\n\n#### CSS\nThere's a CSS alternative to `react-sticky`: the `position: sticky` feature. However it currently does not have [full browser support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-sticky), specifically a lack of IE11 support and some bugs with table elements. Before using `react-sticky`, check to see if the browser support and restrictions prevent you from using `position: sticky`, as CSS will always be faster and more durable than a JS implementation.\n```css\nposition: -webkit-sticky;\nposition: sticky;\ntop: 0;\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install react-sticky\n```\n\n## Overview & Basic Example\n\nThe goal of `react-sticky` is make it easier for developers to build UIs that have sticky elements. Some examples include a sticky navbar, or a two-column layout where the left side sticks while the right side scrolls.\n\n`react-sticky` works by calculating the position of a `<Sticky>` component relative to a `<StickyContainer>` component. If it would be outside the viewport, the styles required to affix it to the top of the screen are passed as an argument to a render callback, a function passed as a child.\n\n```js\n<StickyContainer>\n  <Sticky>{({ style }) => <h1 style={style}>Sticky element</h1>}</Sticky>\n</StickyContainer>\n```\n\nThe majority of use cases will only need the style to pass to the DOM, but some other properties are passed for advanced use cases:\n\n* `style` _(object)_ - modifiable style attributes to optionally be passed to the element returned by this function. For many uses, this will be the only attribute needed.\n* `isSticky` _(boolean)_ - is the element sticky as a result of the current event?\n* `wasSticky` _(boolean)_ - was the element sticky prior to the current event?\n* `distanceFromTop` _(number)_ - number of pixels from the top of the `Sticky` to the nearest `StickyContainer`'s top\n* `distanceFromBottom` _(number)_ - number of pixels from the bottom of the `Sticky` to the nearest `StickyContainer`'s bottom\n* `calculatedHeight` _(number)_ - height of the element returned by this function\n\nThe `Sticky`'s child function will be called when events occur in the parent `StickyContainer`,\nand will serve as the callback to apply your own logic and customizations, with sane `style` attributes\nto get you up and running quickly.\n\n### Full Example\n\nHere's an example of all of those pieces together:\n\napp.js\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { StickyContainer, Sticky } from 'react-sticky';\n// ...\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <StickyContainer>\n        {/* Other elements can be in between `StickyContainer` and `Sticky`,\n        but certain styles can break the positioning logic used. */}\n        <Sticky>\n          {({\n            style,\n\n            // the following are also available but unused in this example\n            isSticky,\n            wasSticky,\n            distanceFromTop,\n            distanceFromBottom,\n            calculatedHeight\n          }) => (\n            <header style={style}>\n              {/* ... */}\n            </header>\n          )}\n        </Sticky>\n        {/* ... */}\n      </StickyContainer>\n    );\n  },\n};\n```\n\nWhen the \"stickiness\" becomes activated, the arguments to the sticky function\nare modified. Similarly, when deactivated, the arguments will update accordingly.\n\n### `<StickyContainer />` Props\n\n`<StickyContainer />` supports all valid `<div />` props.\n\n### `<Sticky />` Props\n\n#### relative _(default: false)_\n\nSet `relative` to `true` if the `<Sticky />` element will be rendered within\nan overflowing `<StickyContainer />` (e.g. `style={{ overflowY: 'auto' }}`) and you want\nthe `<Sticky />` behavior to react to events only within that container.\n\nWhen in `relative` mode, `window` events will not trigger sticky state changes. Only scrolling\nwithin the nearest `StickyContainer` can trigger sticky state changes.\n\n#### topOffset _(default: 0)_\n\nSticky state will be triggered when the top of the element is `topOffset` pixels from the top of the closest `<StickyContainer />`. Positive numbers give the impression of a lazy sticky state, whereas negative numbers are more eager in their attachment.\n\napp.js\n\n```js\n<StickyContainer>\n  ...\n  <Sticky topOffset={80}>\n    { props => (...) }\n  </Sticky>\n  ...\n</StickyContainer>\n```\n\nThe above would result in an element that becomes sticky once its top is greater than or equal to 80px away from the top of the `<StickyContainer />`.\n\n#### bottomOffset _(default: 0)_\n\nSticky state will be triggered when the bottom of the element is `bottomOffset` pixels from the bottom of the closest `<StickyContainer />`.\n\napp.js\n\n```js\n<StickyContainer>\n  ...\n  <Sticky bottomOffset={80}>\n    { props => (...) }\n  </Sticky>\n  ...\n</StickyContainer>\n```\n\nThe above would result in an element that ceases to be sticky once its bottom is 80px away from the bottom of the `<StickyContainer />`.\n\n#### disableCompensation _(default: false)_\n\nSet `disableCompensation` to `true` if you do not want your `<Sticky />` to apply padding to\na hidden placeholder `<div />` to correct \"jumpiness\" as attachment changes from `position:fixed`\nand back.\n\napp.js\n\n```js\n<StickyContainer>\n  ...\n  <Sticky disableCompensation>\n    { props => (...) }\n  </Sticky>\n  ...\n</StickyContainer>\n```\n\n#### disableHardwareAcceleration _(default: false)_\n\nWhen `disableHardwareAcceleration` is set to `true`, the `<Sticky />` element will not use hardware acceleration (e.g. `transform: translateZ(0)`). This setting is not recommended as it negatively impacts\nthe mobile experience, and can usually be avoided by improving the structure of your DOM.\n\napp.js\n\n```js\n<StickyContainer>\n  ...\n  <Sticky disableHardwareAcceleration>\n    { props => (...) }\n  </Sticky>\n  ...\n</StickyContainer>\n```\n",
